        <h4>SMS</h4>
        <p>
How many characters can I have in my message?</p>
        
        <p>1 SMS is 160 characters in length. You can send longer messages using a process called concatenation. We use speacial characters to join the SMS together and deliver them as one message. Due to the use of characters to join the messages there are inconsistencies in the length of following SMS. This is the break down.</p>

        <p>Do I pay for each SMS in my message?</p>
        <p>Yes, we charge for each SMS sent, not each message sent.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>If you send 10 messages that are 160 characters and under (1 SMS) in length, you will be charged for 10 message</li>
         <li>If you send 10 messages that are 306 characters and under (2 SMS) in length, you will be charged for 20 messages</li>
        
        </ul>
        <p>Do spaces and line breaks add to my character count?</p>
        <p>Yes, each line break, space and carriage return adds to your character count.</p>
        
          <ul>
        <li>1 space = 1 character</li>
         <li>1 line break = 2 characters</li>
        
        </ul>

        
        <p>If I use a <firstname> variable in my message can that make my meassage too long?
We count every character in a variable. If you have a message that is 152 charcters in length and the name that is inserted into the variable is 9 characters in length you will be charged for 2 SMS (152 + 9 = 161). We suggest that you find the longest name in your list and keep enough spare characters in your message to allow for it.</p>
