   <p>Through this software product, Complete Business Online provides website operators and other individuals with a variety of tools and resources (including our website) to enable them to collect visitor mobile numbers and to create, launch, and manage online SMS campaigns (the “Services”).</p>
        
        <p>The Services are provided subject to these terms and conditions, which also incorporate our Anti-Spam policy, our Privacy Policy, and any other guidelines, rules or operating policies that Complete Business Online may establish and post on our website from time to time (collectively the “Agreement”). The servers we use to provide the Services (the “Servers”) are located in the Australia, UK, Hong Kong and United States. In the event that data is transferred to our Servers from within the European Economic Area our Data Transfer Clauses will apply to that transfer and will form part of this Agreement.</p>
        
        <p>Please read this Agreement carefully before proceeding with any use of our website or the Services. By checking the “I have read and agree to the Complete Business Online Agreement. I accept these terms and conditions” box on the Sign Up page or after logging in for the first time, you accept and agree to be bound by this Agreement.</p>
        <p>If you do not accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please exit this website and cease using the Services immediately.</p>
        
        <h4>1. Services and Support 
</h4>
        <p>1.1 By posting updated versions of the Agreement on the Complete Business Online website, or otherwise providing notice to you, Complete Business Online may modify the terms of this Agreement and may discontinue or revise any or all other aspects of the Services at its sole discretion. All such changes shall become effective upon posting of the revised Agreement on the Complete Business Online website. Your continued use of the Services will constitute your acceptance of the variation to the Agreement. Complete Business Online will use reasonable efforts to make you aware of any changes to the terms of this Agreement. If you elect to discontinue using the Services due to any changes to the Agreement made under this section 1.1, you will be entitled to a refund for any unused, prepaid amounts for the Services.</p>
        <p>1.2 The Services are available only to persons who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Services are not available to individuals under the age of 18. If you do not qualify, your use of the Services is expressly prohibited.</p>
        
        <p>1.3 The Services enable corporate, small business and community websites to sign up website visitors, collect and retrieve visitor sign-up data, and to develop and execute SMS communications with visitors and others (including your customers).</p>
        
        <p>1.4 Both the number of SMS messages sent and the number of characters of data transferred are metered by Complete Business Online. Normal Complete Business Online accounts allow you to send an unlimited number of SMS messages. The maximum character count for each message can be no more than 612 characters, being 4 concatenated SMS messages.</p>
        
        <p>1.5 All SMS delivery prices are subject to change at any time. All fees paid to Complete Business Online for the Services are non-refundable, unless an account is terminated by you under clause 1.1 or by Complete Business Online for a reason other than violation of the Anti-Spam Policy. Payment for Services must be made in advance by a valid credit card accepted by Complete Business Online, unless other payment arrangements have been made between you and an authorised Complete Business Online representative. You hereby authorize Complete Business Online to deduct funds from your pre-paid balance whenever you use the Services. Fees are payable in AUD, GBP or USD. If Complete Business Online is for any reason unable to effect automatic payment via your credit card, you will be notified via email. All prices are subject to change and you are responsible for reviewing the Pricing Schedule from time to time and for remaining aware of the fees charged by Complete Business Online for the Services.</p>
        <p>1.6 For all accounts, Complete Business Online may charge an account re-activation fee should an account need to be re-activated by a customer after an account has become de-activated due to non-payment, SPAM issue, or an untimely authorization for payment, or any other breach of this Agreement.</p>
        
        <p>1.7 You must complete the registration form on the signup page in order to use the Services. You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as requested in the registration form. As part of the registration process, you will identify a mobile number, username and password for your Complete Business Online account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, username, passwords, and files and for all uses of your account and of the Services in your name. Complete Business Online reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel accounts it deems inappropriate.</p>
        
    <p>1.8 It is understood that Complete Business Online makes no guarantee that SMS messages will be rendered properly on all recipients’ mobile phones, due to the wide variety of mobile phones available. Complete Business Online makes every reasonable attempt to make sure that all SMS messages sent through our servers follow global SMS standards.</p>
